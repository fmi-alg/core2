Authors of Core Library
(in chronological order of initial contribution)

==================================================
It is sometimes difficult to associate authors with a particular
source file, because the files evolve and gets split up or merged
over time.   The year that an author worked on Core Library can
be roughly correlated with the version of Core Library.
