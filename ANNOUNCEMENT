===================== SOFTWARE RELEASE ANNOUNCEMENT ==========================

July 1, 2010:
Core Library Version 2.1 is now available for free download at

                 http://cs.nyu.edu/exact/core/

The Core Library (CORE) is a collection of C/C++ classes to support 
computation with real numbers with the following set of operations
	+, -, x, /, radicals, rootOf, elementary functions
under a variety of precision requirements.  When the real number
is algebraic, CORE guarantees any desired relative precision
(this implies error-free comparisons).  For non-algebraic real numbers,
CORE guarantees any desired absolute precision.  Elementary functions include 
log (also log2 and log10), exp (also exp2, exp10),
trigonometric functions (sine, cosine, tangent) and
their inverses (arcsine, arccos, arctan), as well as constants such as Pi and e.

Numerical nonrobustness is a widely acknowledged problem.  It has proven
particularly intractable in the context of geometric algorithms where
numerical data and combinatorial data are intermixed in a strongly constrained
manner.  Recent research in computational geometry has
demonstrated a variety of techniques based on the principles of
Exact Geometric Computation (EGC) that can address such problems.
A basic goal of our library is to make such techniques easily accessible to 
the wider community of programmers and researchers.

Basic CORE Features:
   -- ease of use:
        Any C/C++ programmer can write numerical or geometric
        code that are fully robust by calling our Library.
   -- ease of migration:
        Many existing C/C++ programs can be converted into robust CORE
        programs with minimal effort.
   -- natural and novel numerical accuracy model:
        Users can choose and get the numerical accuracy that best fit
        their applications. 
   -- state of art technology:
        The precision-driven approach to EGC, best known root bounds,
        filter technology, etc, are incorporated into the library
        as the research progresses.  Thus, users' application programs
        are automatically be upgraded (at the cost of re-compilation).
   -- modest size system:
        It can serve as the "robust core" of your own applications.
   -- tested on Unix, MacOS, Linux, cygwin and Windows platforms.
   -- interpreted Python-based version called Incore, for rapid
   	prototyping and experimentation

What is new with CORE 2.1 ?

   Core 2.1 is the latest version of Core2, a completely redesigned
	Core Library.  From the outside, Core2 looks the same as the
	original Core Library, which we now call Core1.  But internally,
	these are new in Core2, as introduced in Core 2.0:

	-- modularized design of Expr class, based on three template
		classes (Filter class, Root bound class, Kernel class)
   	-- incorporation of transcendental functions into Expr
	-- new BigFloat and BigFloat2 engine, based on gmp/mpfr
	-- facility for users to design new Expr nodes
	-- improved Precision-Driven evaluation of expressions
	-- introduction of EscapeBound and CutOffBounds

    What is new in Core 2.1 (over Core 2.0)?
	-- introduction of anary nodes (operators with no fixed arity,
	   such as sum and product)
	-- introduced a DoubleWrapper as a thinwrapper over
	   machine double in Level 1: now Level 2 and Level 3 programs
	   can also compile at Level 1.
	-- templated linearAlgebra extension
	-- templated interval class
	-- templated complex number class
	-- various bug fixes, including root bound overflow bug and
	   printout of garbage digits but.

We welcome your comments and input.
