README File for CORE EXTENSIONS

CURRENT EXTENSION PACKAGES

(1) Linear Algebra:
	implements Vectors and Matrices,
	implements determinant
(2) Geometry:
	divided into geom2d and geom3d (together: "geom*d")
	implements
		Point*d, Line*d, Segment*d
		Circle2d, 
		Plane3d, Triangle3d, Polygon3d

	Note that geom3d is independent of geom2d.  In particular,
		we test if a point is in a triangle in space
		by direct primitives in 3-d, and not by projection
		to the planar case.

(3) Graphics:
	elementary display methods based on openGL
