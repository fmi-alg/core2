1) These are simple programs to test the geometric primitives
   in Core Extensions,  LinearAlg and Geometry

2) To make and test all the (non-LEDA) test program, do

	% make 
	% make test

3) In the above, the default Accuracy CORE_LEVEL is 3, but
   you can compile and test the same programs at CORE_LEVEL 1 by doing

	% make veryclean
	% make LEV=1
	% make test

4) Some of the programs here need LEDA.  If you want
   to make and test these, do:

	% make allLeda
	% make testLeda
