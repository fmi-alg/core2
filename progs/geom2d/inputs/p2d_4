# file: p2d_4
#	This input file has 4 points
# 	It can be read (as istream) using
#
#		readPoints(istream iS, Point2d * pA, int MaxN, int N=0)
#
# 	to illustrate the variants we allow for specifying points:
#	The NORMAL format for a sequence of points is
#		( x1 , y1 ) ( x2 , y2 ) ... ( xN, yN)
#	The important thing to note is that you must not have commas
#	between successive points.  But omitting "(" or "," or ")" turns
#	out to be acceptable!  This is illustrated here.

4		# This says there are 4 points following.
		# If there are more than 4 points, the rest is ignored.
		# This value can be omitted if N is given directly
		# as the 4th argument to readPoints.
1 1		# point 1
   -1    +2	# point 2 
1.0 -3		# point 3 
 -0.0 4.0	# point 4 
9.2 -5.0	# point 5 -- will be ignored
