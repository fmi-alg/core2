README for CONVEX HULL data files
=============================================================
This directory contains sample input files for
the chull program (and its variant chull4).

   The input files for chull begin with small letters:
	cube, points1, points2, etc.

   The input files for chull4 begins with capital letters:
	Cube, Points1, Points2, etc.

=============================================================
DIFFERENCE between chull and chull4 is
just in the format of the input files.

(1) chull input file:
	this is just a sequence of numbers

	   x1 x2 x3 x4 x5 ...

	So the first point is (x1, x2, x3),
	and the next point is (x4, x5, x6), etc.

(2) chull4 input file :
	this is a sequence of quadruples of the form

        	(x1, y1, z1, w1)
        	(x2, y2, z2, w2)
        	(x3, y3, z3, w3)
		...

	where the fourth coordinate (w's) is
	the homogenizing coordinate (usually set to 1).
