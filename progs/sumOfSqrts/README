file: README file for sumOfSqrts
Since CORE Library Version 1.2, August 1999

This directory contains

1) graham.cpp
	This compares two sums of 10 square roots each,
	from Ron Graham.  The sums are equal up to 36 digits.

2) orourke.cpp
	This compares small sums of square roots, taken
	from O'Rourke.  The original test was to compare the
	performance with the "incrementalEvalFlag" set to true or false.
	This affects only the squareroot evaluation algorithm, but it
	is no longer supported in Core2.

3) smallsum.cpp
	This is a technique for generating very small
	sum of square roots which we discovered.
