Since Core Library Version 1.4
========================

This file contains some experimental results on
our BFS filter implementation.  The tests are on
Solaris 2.8, CPU 440 MHz, 512M Memory.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
TEST 1:  
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

	We first create 1000 random 3x3 matrices with 10-bit entries.
	Then we compute the determines of these matrices, with and
	without the filter.  We check that the filtered results
	are the same as the unfiltered results.  The speeds of
	the two methods are also compared:

	>  ./createMatrices inputs/1000x3x10matrices 1000 3 10
	    Generate 1000 random matrices...
	    Done.

	>  ./testFilter inputs/1000x3x10matrices
	    CORRECT!
	    Total USER time spent w/ filter : 0.54 seconds
	    Total USER time spent w/o filter : 1.8 seconds
	    Speedup: 70%

TEST 2:  This is equivalent to "make test"
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

	===========================================================
	MATRIX		w/filter	w/o filter	% speedup
	========	========	==========	=========
	200x3x10	0.15 seconds	0.3 seconds	50%
	200x4x20	0.23		1.14		79%
	200x5x30	0.4		2.95		86%
	===========================================================

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
TEST 3:  This is equivalent to "make moretest"
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

	===========================================================
	MATRIX		w/filter	w/o filter	% speedup
	========	========	==========	=========
	1000x2x10	0.23 seconds	0.54 seconds	57%
	1000x3x10	0.57 		1.81 		68%
	1000x4x10	1.06		5.61		81%
	500x5x10	1.19		6.62		82%
	500x6x10	9.05		14.17		36%
	500x7x10	25.49		28.32		9%
	500x8x10	38.79		42.19		8%
	===========================================================

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
TEST 4:  Using more bits 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

	===========================================================
	MATRIX		w/filter	w/o filter	% speedup
	========	========	==========	=========
	200x10x100	40.49 seconds	40.75 seconds	0%
	200x20x100	558.76		565.84		1%
	===========================================================

Note: this result is expected -- filters are only effective when
the determinant has few bits that can be decided at machine precision.
