Randomly Generated Matrices & Timing Results

############################################################

1. Input files.
	The input files in this directory contains randomly generated
	square matrices.  Each file contains NNN matrices, each of 
	dimension DDD.  If NNN=1000 and DDD=4, then the file is named

			1000x4matrices

	Here are some of the files:

		1000x2matrices
		1000x3matrices
		1000x4matrices
		 500x5matrices
		 500x6matrices

2. How are the matrices generated?

   The entrices of all matrices are generated by the following formula:

	int L = 10;
	BigInt BASE1 = 1; BASE1 <<= (L-1);
	BigInt BASE2 = 2; BASE2 <<=  L;
	
	double x = BASE1 + randomize(BASE1);
	double y = BASE2 + randomize(BASE2);

	"entry of matrix" = x/y;    

3. Timing results (time in seconds)

	INPUT FILE	w/ filter (sec)	w/o filter(sec) Speedup (%)
