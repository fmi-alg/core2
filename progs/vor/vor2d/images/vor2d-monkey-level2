The image 
	vor2d-monkey-level2.tiff

    is produced by vor2d program, running at Level 2.

    It takes an appreciable amount of time, and its output out
    to be compared to the output at Level 1, to see if there is
    any difference.

    We ought to check this automatically by looking at their
    corresponding Voronoi graphs.
