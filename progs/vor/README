Description:
	This directory has various subdirectoris containing algorithms
	for robotics, especially motion planning.

	(1) Subdirectory 2d-disc:
	This implements the SSS algorithm for moving a disc amidst polygonal
	obstacles, using the soft-predicated described in the
	paper "Numerical Subdivision Methods in Motion Planning" by
	Y.-J.Chiang and C.Yap (2011).

Authors:
	J-M. Lien, C.Yap, V.Sharma (2012)
	Huck Bennett, C.Yap (2015-6)
