# This polygonal set comprises three triangles A, B, C:
#
#             /\        /\        /\
#            /  \      /  \      /  \
#           /____\    /____\    /____\     ---------- (H)
#              A         B         C
#
# The bases of these triangles almost lie on a horizontal line H.
# In fact, the bases of A and C lie on H,
# but the base of C is only slightly below H (say epsilon below).
#
# The apices of these triangles define a Voronoi vertex (V)
# whose distance above H is inversely proportional to epsilon.
#
# CONSIDER the subdivision box B that contains V:
# The connection rules
