	A complex number package developed primarily for use
	in the CEVAL algorithm (progs/mesh/ceval) . It contains
	(reasonably) complete implementations of polar and
	cartesian complex number classes. All basic arithmetic
	operations on complex numbers are defined, as well as
	conversions between the two types.

--Narayan (June 2010)

NOTES:
Dec 2016: Modified Makefile so that we use the Debug-version of
	Corelib in order to turn assertions on!
	Will adapt homotopy path code with Burr/Xu to work with Core.
