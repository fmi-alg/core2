README for progs/bareiss

Implementation of the Bareiss algorithm for computing determinants
of matrices. This version performs pivoting
(compare Gaussian.cc in ${CORE}/progs/gaussian). 

For the theory behind this code, read Chapter 10 of
Chee's book "Fundamental Problems of Algorithmic Algebra"
(Oxford Press 2000).  Available from http://cs.nyu.edu/yap/book/).

The input matrices are hard-coded.
