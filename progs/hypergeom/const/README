Synopsis:
	Facility to compute various mathematical constants:
		-- Pi
		-- Log(2)
		-- e (not done here, but easily done)
		-- 1/e (unimplemented)
		-- 1/Pi (unimplemented)

	and store them in a file.

History:
	Aug, 2001: The Hypergeometry Package was Originally designed by
		Maria Eleftheriou, <mariae@us.ibm.com> and
		Jose Moreira, <jmoreira@us.ibm.com>
		IBM T.J. Watson Research Center
	May, 2002: Improvements and additional contributions
		(preprocessing of hypergeometric arguments,
		file input of arbitrary precision constants,
		improved automatic error analysis) by
		Chee Yap <yap@cs.nyu.edu>
		Zilin Du <zilin@cs.nyu.edu>
