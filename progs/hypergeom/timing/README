Synopsis:
	Some timing tests.
	
	timehyper -- timing for evaluating elementary functions at 
			different precision
	timepi -- timing for computing pi on the fly and reading from file
	timelog -- timing for computing log using standard and transformed
			hypergeometric series.
	

Notes:
	Certain arguments can make the evaluation very slow:
		e.g., arccos and arcsin at arguments near to 0.5,
		e.g., log at values close to 0.
