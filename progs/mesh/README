Description:
	This directory has various subdirectoris containing mesh-related code:

(1) Subdirectories cxy and PV:
	They implement the Cxy and Rect Algorithms
	for Approximating Algebraic Curves, based on the paper
	   "Adaptive Isotopci Approximation of NonSingular Curves:
		the Parametrizability and Nonlocal Isotopy Approach"
	by Long Lin and Chee Yap (Proceedings of SoCG 2009).
	
	The algorithms of Plantinga-Vegter (PV) and Snyder for
	curve approximations are also implemented, for comparison.
	
	All these algorithms are based on the "subdivision method"
	which begins with a rectangular region and repeatedly
	subdivides them.  The 3-D version of such methods usually
	produces a "mesh" (we plan to go to the 3-D version eventually).
	
	The original implementation was by Long Lin, in Java.
	This is ported to Core Library by Shuxing Lu.
	Narayan further improved the code, and factored out various modules.

(2) Subdirectories krawczyk, ceval and benchmark:
	These are from Narayan's thesis at Oxford (2010).  They implement
	the various Newton methods for root isolation for a pair of polynomials,
	and also the CEVAL algorithm.   In Benchmark, these algorithms
	are compared.
	The results in ceval/krawczyk/benchmark applications form the
	Masters Thesis of Narayan Kamath from Oxford University Computing
	Laboratory (Sep 2010), supervised by Irina Voilescu and Chee Yap.

(3) Subdirectory miranda:
	This is the summer project of Shang Wang (2011)
	implementing the modified Miranda test, which led to an
	implementation of the new curve arrangement algorithm of Sharma and Yap.
