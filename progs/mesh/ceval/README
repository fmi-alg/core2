TODO:
    -- convertPoly.cpp needs to handle float coefficients for frisco format

    	This is located in the switch statement of GetPoly (...)

    -- compilation to level 2 needs to be done

          > make all_lev

	 currently works for level 1 only.

    -- modify predicates.cpp so that whenever the polynomials get read in,
         it will call the appropriate version of GetPoly (from above)

    -- In predicates:
    	the repeated switching to RoundUp and RoundDown is expensive.

    	Should do the trick to only RoundUp:
	Then lower bound should be computed as the RoundUp of the negation.

	DO SOME TESTS.
