//Zhaoji at 2018.1.30
//problems:
//1*******. Seem I could only use precision to control precision(1-16)? the other way is using "Expr.r_approx(prec_of_output)", I need to modify the functions ----
//      "toString" in poly.h    and     "<<" in Interval.h
// prec_of_output is things like:
//       "digits2bits(unsigned long digits)"
// see "t_expr.cpp" about the way to print "Expr"


//2*******. my CORE could not execute Level 1! (see tutorial.pdf P7)
