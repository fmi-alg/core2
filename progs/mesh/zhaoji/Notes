Dear Prof. Yap:

	I have finished programming of my graduation project. Generally, it's about coding problem but I'm really interest in the axiom behind algorithms used. I will detailedly describe it and I sincerely hope that my program could be updated in CORE! 

Program name: Subdivision solver for bivariate polynomial system
Aiming: Efficiently isolating real root and refining box region
Algorithms: Please check "Algorithms of isolation" by Juan Xu and "Algorithms of Refinement"

	To successfully run the program based on CORE, We only need to revise file "mk-inl.h" because of syntactic difference( I specify it in "README" ). No any program will be influenced in this way. 


	Please download the attachment and put decompressed folder at 

$(CORE_PATH)/progs

then check"README"  or "procedure" 


Questions:
1. I wrote all functions as template function, but did that really need so? In other word: Are there any other data-type( different with Expr) that could be used in representation of real functions?



Best wish,
Wang

Dear Zhaoji,
Thanks!   I will go over this and get back to you shortly.

Dear Zhaoji,

I had been quite busy the last month.
I would like to put your code into the Core Library for others to use.
I am consulting with Juan Xu about how to do this properly.
We have some questions:

(1) How is this program related to a bivariate solver already in Core Library (it would
be nice to compare them).  This is the solver in progs/mesh/arrangements (and arrangements-gui).

(2) You have used Expr for several things -- that is definitely not necessary.  We will have
to skype to go over this point.

(3)  I did not succeed in compiling,but I will try again.
But ideally, can you create a version that I can compile if I unpack your
program in progs/mesh/zhaoji?  (Please create a Makefile that works at this depth
of the Core Library).

Can we skype later this week?

Thanks,
--Chee

Dear Prof.Yap,

Thank you for response!
I went through the bivariate solver already in Core Library you just mentioned, and I found it's nearly the same work I did...! So I do not think it's necessary putting my project on the Core.( I implemented it in the same way and I designed some refinement algorithms for isolating boxes. However, it cannot be called as a project and we do not need them in future work)

I'm working on parameter box isolating for parameterized polynomial system now. I hope I could do some original work and contribute to your library in future. 
Hope to see you in Beijing.

Best wish,
Zhaoji
