The 22 roots in the file chrmc23.res
are obtained by MPSOLVE using the command:

	> unisolve -Ga -Db -o100 Data/chrmc23.pol > Results/ch

DISCUSSION:
	This is impressive, because the current implementation of
	CEVAL (June 2012) using LEVEL 1 accuracy, could only identified 12 roots
	and give 72 ambiguous boxes).
	NOTE that CEVAL is guaranteed correct UNLESS there is overflow
	or underflow during the computation.   Of course, we did not check
	this (TODO), so even the 12 purported roots might have some problems if this happens.
	For instance, when we zoom into the ambiguous region to higher accuracy, the
	ambiguity vanishes and no roots are found.   Clearly, over/underflow occurred.
	
	On closer look at MPSolve's output, we can see at once that four of the roots
	are numerically identical:
	
	(0.2e1, 0.e-124)
	
	which may be interpreted to be (2, 0). 
	
	MPSolve does not tell us whether these
	are four identical roots, or four distinct roots (or anything in between).
	
	There are other "potential multiple roots" in this MPSolve output:
	just look at the pair of roots just before (2,0).
	
	I believe it is inherently impossible for a "numerical algorithm"
	like MPSolve to decide multiple roots  (of course CEVAL is no better in this regards).
	
	STILL, I am impressed that MPSolve COULD tell us that there is
	a cluster of four roots here.  
	
	HERE is what CEVAL can do that MPSolve cannot:
	it is possible in Level 2, to decide whether these "potential multiple roots"
	are multiple roots or distinct ones  -- I can compute
	a root separation bound, and compute the that accuracy.
	It might take a long time, but eventually we will know.
	(TODO).
