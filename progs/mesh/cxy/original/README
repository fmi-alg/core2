In Makefile:
	There are many examples in here.
	For example, try

		> make eg1
		> make eg2
		> ...
	
	The equations for examples 1 and 2 are
		Taylor expansions of some sine-like functions.
		So the coefficients are divided by factorials:
			3!=6, 4!=24, 5!=120
	Actually, our parser do not accept rational coefficients!
	So the plotted curves are not what is intended.
	This is remedied as examples 1a and 2a.
