Synopsis:
	This directory contains generic instructions for compiling and
	building user's own CORE programs.  The most important file here
	is the Makefile program.  It assumes that your program is found in
	some directory under $(CORE_PATH)/progs/.

The sample program (sample.cpp) is intended to be run at any CORE
	Accuracy level (1, 2, 3, 4). Try it and see!
	Only at CORE_LEVEL 3 should the program work with the right
	accuracy.

NOTE: Sometimes, you want to create a testing environment
	where your programs at several Accuracy Levels.
	Please see, e.g., $(CORE_PATH)/progs/geom2d/ 
	or $(CORE_PATH)/progs/gaussian/ for examples
	of such Makefiles.
