README for determinant directory
================================

These programs are used to produce the experimental results
described in the paper,

"Constructive Root Bound Method for k-Ary Rational Input Numbers"
	by Sylvain Pion and Chee Yap,
        To appear in Proc. 19th ACM Symp. Comp.Geom., June 2003.

Basically, we compare the various root bounds of
three different methods of computing the determinant:

	1) gaussian elimination
	2) factorial expansion method
	3) dynamic programming method

files:
   Makefile		-- 
   determinant.ccp	-- testing the correctness of filter
   createMatrices.ccp	-- generates random matrices
   dynamicProgrammingCodeGenerator
   			-- generates CGAL code for determinant evaluation
				using dynamic programming
directories:
   inputs		-- matrices generated by createMatrices are put here

NOTES:
-- Jan 2010 (Jihun/Chee):
	Bus error when determinant is runned under MacOS with g++-4.0.1
	PROBLEM is fixed: It has to do with the fact linearAlgebra.h has
	static matrices whose entries are zeros.  This uses ZeroConst,
	which is a static Expr object.  But C++ standard does allow
	dependencies among static objects in different compilation units
	(in this case, coreExpr.cpp and linearAlgebra.cpp).
