(1) This directory implements Mantyla's Geometric Workbench
      (taken from his Solid Modeling book)
      
            The main program in this directory is called "gwb.cpp".
            It can read a sequence of Euler operators from a *.gwb file
            to build a geometric model.

(2) Format for *.gwb files:
    These are line-oriented ASCII files with
       -- single-line comments indicated by "#" (rest of line is ignored)
       -- continuation character indicated by "/" (the current line is joined
            with the next line)
       -- a sequence of semi-colon terminated GWB Euler operations
            (mvfs, mev, mef, kev, kef, ... etc)
       -- the last command is just "end".
