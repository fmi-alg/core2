=============================================================================
SYNOPSIS:
	Miscellaneous test programs related to Core Library

	floor_ceil.cpp 
		includes some tests for the functions
		"BigInt floor(Expr)" and  "BigInt ceil(Expr)".
	
	invalid.cpp
		tests the behavior of CORE on invalid inputs

	bench.cpp
		print out the root bounds for various expressions:
			E_1: sqrt(x) + sqrt(y) - sqrt(x+y + 2*sqrt(x*y))
			E_2: (sqrt(x) - sqrt(y))/(x-y)
	        bench_1 computes the root bound for E_1.
	        bench_2 computes the root bound for E_2 - E_2.
	
	linn.cpp, jihun.cpp:
		Comparison of naive floating-point summation with
		compensated floating-point summation.

	schmidtt.cpp
		fixing a bug reported by Susanne Schmidtt.

	coreid.cpp
		Looking at types in Core Library.
