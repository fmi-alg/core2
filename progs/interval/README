README file for progs/interval

	Interval arithmetic was factored out from the mesh/cxy code, and
	re-designed for general use in Core2 by Narayan Kamath.
	Although BigFloat2 is a form of interval arithmetic
	in Core2, its general use as number type is somewhat problematic 
	because it is specialized to be the numerical engine
	for the Expr class.   So it makes sense to write a general
	interval arithmetic package.

	Extended Interval Arithmetic (which allows division by
	zero, resulting in two intervals) has to be tested here as well.

	A future goal of Core2 is to admit Expr with intervals
	at leaves.  This has many implications and applications!!
