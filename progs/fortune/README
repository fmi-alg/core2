README for fortune directory

There are 2 subdirectories
	vor  -- this is the CORE version of Fortune's implementation of
		his Voronoi diagram algorithm for a 2-D point set
	pred -- this contains timing tests for some predicates
		(and generalizations) used in Fortune's algorithm.
		These tests were described in the paper
		"A New Constructive Root Bound for Algebraic Expression" 
		(SODA 2001).
