SYNOPSIS:
	Fortune's sweepline algorithm for Voronoi diagram of a 2-D point set.

     output.ccp
     PQlist.h 
     voronoi.ccp 

Compiling Instructions:
======================

     Simply invoke "make test" to compile and run a simple test.

Running Instructions:
====================

     The program reads from standard input and writes standard output:

	% voronoi [-dctsp] < input_file > output_file

     The input file is a text file containing a sequence of points: e.g.,
	     	0.1 0.3 
		0.1 0.5
		0.9 0.9
		0.5 0.1
     The output is a text file describing the Voronoi diagram of the input points.

     The following options are available:
     -d:	(debug mode) more verbose version of the default output
     -c:	postscript output
     -t:	compute Delaunay triangulaation instead of Vor.Diagram
     -s:	sort the input points (to speed up computation)
     -p:	plot option (this is disabled)


     See main.cpp for more information.
