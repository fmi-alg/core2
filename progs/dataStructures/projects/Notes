Feb 2017: Chee's work with Sam Phelan
	(1) Implement the lower bounds splits of
		our paper (this is nice validation of our paper)
	(2) Introduce a non-smooth version
	(3) Implement the Omega(log n) bound for non-smooth splits
		(But this requires implementing the non-smooth version first)
	(4) Implement our robotics motion planning code using smooth splits
		(general SSS framework)
	(5) Show experimentally the cost of smoothness/non-smoothness
