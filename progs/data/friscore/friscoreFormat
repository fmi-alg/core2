File: FriscoreFormat:

The following describes the "Friscore Format" for polynomials,
adapted from the "Frisco Format".

A. FILE FORMAT
	Each file is an ASCII text file and contains one polynomial.
	Each line in the file is interpreted in this order:

  A.0. Comment lines:
	These are lines that begin with "!".  We do not count them
	in the description that follows.
	E.g.,
	  ! This is the Wilkinson polynomial of degree n
	  ! defined by p(x)=(x-1)(x-2)...(x-n)
	
	CHECK: Comment lines can be interspersed throughout the file.

  A.1. The first line contains 3 characters "abc" defined by the Frisco
  	format: 

	"a" can take one of the values:
	      + d  for dense polynomial
	      + s  for sparse polynomial
	      + u  for user polynomial
	THE "Friscore Format" corresponds to "a" = "u" !!!

	"b" can take the values:
	      + r  for real coefficient.  
	      + c  for complex coefficients
	"c" can take the values
	      + i  for integer coefficient.  
	      + q  for rational coefficients
	      + f for float coefficients

	E.g., "abc" = "uri"
		stands for real integer polynomial in Friscore Format.

  A.2.  The next line is the name of the variable (typically, 'x' or 'X')

  A.3.  The rest is just an expression that evaluates to the polynomial:

  	E.g.,
		x^2 - 3 x + 1
  	E.g.,
		x^5 = (-3x - 2.1) x^2 

		1 + x( -3 + x ( 2.2 - x (5 + x^2)))  

	The expression can 
		(1) contain at most one "="
		(2) as many pairs of parentheses as desired,
			arbitrarily nested.
		(3) coefficients are either integers, rational numbers,
			or floating point numbers.
			However, the coefficients must respect
			the "bc" specification of "abc" in line 1.
		(4) The floating point format can support the
			"scientific notation"

B. EXAMPLES

C. COEFFICIENT FORMATS

  1. Integer coefficients of any length can be used such as real
	coefficients in scientific format.

  2. Complex values are coded as the real part followed the imaginary part.

  3. Rational numbers are written as the numerator followed by the denominator.

  4. Complex numbers with rational real and imaginary parts are coded
	as a quadruples as follows:
	
	* numerator of the real part
	* denominator of the real part
	* numerator of the imaginary part
	* denominator of the imaginary part.

D. COEFFICIENT EXAMPLES
	Below we report some examples of input formats where
	the coefficients are:

   D.1 complex integer (Gaussian) numbers,

	! p(x)=1.234e200 x^3 + 1.5e-200 x^2 + 1.3e-200
	! the precision of the coefficients is 15 digits
	drf

	0.0e0

   Any other mix is allowed and the input form follows
	the above lines.  Many coding examples can be found among
	the test suite.
