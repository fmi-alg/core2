The following describes the file format for polynomials
in the FRISCO Test Suite.  This is edited from Bini and Fiorentino:

A. FILE FORMAT
	Each file is an ASCII text file and contains one polynomial.
	Each line in the file is interpreted in this order:

  A.0. Comment lines:
	These are lines that begin with "!".  We do not count them
	in the description that follows.
	E.g.,
	  ! This is the Wilkinson polynomial of degree n
	  ! defined by p(x)=(x-1)(x-2)...(x-n)
	
	CHECK: Comment lines can be interspersed throughout the file.

  A.1. The first line contains 3 characters "abc".  It 
	determine the basic nature of the polynomial:

	"a" can take one of the values:
	      + d  for dense polynomial
	      + s  for sparse polynomial
	      + u  for user polynomial
	"b" can take the values:
	      + r  for real coefficient.  
	      + c  for complex coefficients
	"c" can take the values
	      + i  for integer coefficient.  
	      + q  for rational coefficients
	      + f for float coefficients

	E.g., "abc" = "dri"
		stands for a dense real polynomial with integer coefficients.

  A.2.  The second line gives the precision of the coefficients in
	decimal digits, where 0 denotes the infinite precision
	typical of integer rational coefficients.

  A.3.  The third line gives the degree of the polynomial, as an integer.

  A.4.  Then follows a multi-line description of the coefficients:
	
	* For polynomials coded as dense, each coefficient
	  is in its own line, arranged in increasing degree,
	* For polynomials coded as sparse, the fourth line gives
	  the number of nonzero coefficient.  Then follows a list
	  of alternating degree-coefficient pairs of lines.

B. EXAMPLES

	The polynomial x^4 + 2 x + 5 can be coded as follows
	(extra spaces or tabs are ignored) in two forms:
	
	! p(x)=x^4+2x+5 in sparse form
	dri
	0
	4
	5
	2
	0
	0
	1
	
	! p(x)=x^4+2x+5 in dense form:
	sri
	0
	4
	3
	0
	5
	1
	2
	4
	1

	Clearly, polynomials like x^500 + 1 are more easily written
	in their sparse form as follows:

	! p(x)=x^500+1
	sri
	0
	500
	2
	0
	1
	500
	1

C. COEFFICIENT FORMATS

  1. Integer coefficients of any length can be used such as real
	coefficients in scientific format.

  2. Complex values are coded as the real part followed the imaginary part.

  3. Rational numbers are written as the numerator followed by the denominator.

  4. Complex numbers with rational real and imaginary parts are coded
	as a quadruples as follows:
	
	* numerator of the real part
	* denominator of the real part
	* numerator of the imaginary part
	* denominator of the imaginary part.

D. COEFFICIENT EXAMPLES
	Below we report some examples of input formats where
	the coefficients are:

   D.1 complex integer (Gaussian) numbers,

	! Example 1, complex/integer
	! p(x)=x^200+(1+3i)x^70 +1

	! Example 2, real/rational
	! p(x)=(3/4)x^200 + (1/3)x^70 + 1

   D.3 complex rational numbers (extra blank lines  are skipped),

	! Example 3, complex/rational
	! p(x)=x^2 + (3/2+i*5/7)x + 2
	dcq

   D.4 real floating point numbers

	! Example 4, real/float
	! p(x)=1.234e200 x^3 + 1.5e-200 x^2 + 1.3e-200
	! the precision of the coefficients is 15 digits
	drf
	15
	3

	1.3e-200
	0.0e0
	1.5e-200
	1.234e200

   Any other mix is allowed and the input form follows
	the above lines.  Many coding examples can be found among
	the test suite.
