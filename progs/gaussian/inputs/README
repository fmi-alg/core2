1.  The matrices gregA and gregE are from
	Gregory and Krishnamurthy's book (p.2-3),
	the following matrix has determinant 1:

	-73	78	24

  A =	92	66	25

	-80	37	10

But if we add

	0	0	0

  E =	0	0	0

	0	0	1/100

then det(A+E) = -118.94

2.   The matrix pivot4 is just a permutation matrix.
	So gaussian.cpp will fail on this input.
	The pivoting version will not fail.
