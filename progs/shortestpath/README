README for shortestpath

Among elementary geometric problems, computing shortest paths
is one of the hardest problems from an algebraic view point
because its algebraic degree is unbounded.
The simplest form of such problems is a ``pseudo-geometric'' problem
where we are given
an undirected graph G(V,E) where vertices in V are points in Euclidean space
and edge weights are Euclidean distances between vertices.
