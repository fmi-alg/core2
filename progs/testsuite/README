=================================

These programs exercise the basic constructors
and operations of Core2 number types.

Programs:
	t_bigfloat.cpp
	t_bigint.cpp
	t_bigrat.cpp
	t_expr.cpp
	t_poly.cpp
	kahan.cpp

More tests are found under the subdirectories:
	misc
	mpfr

NOTES:
These tests are done in CORE_LEVEL 4,
as otherwise the typedef
 	typedef unsigned long ulong;
would not work.  You could use "size_t" instead of "unsigned long".
