chullGraham contains O'Rourke's implementation of Graham's
algorithm for computing the convex hull of a set of planar points.

These are the files and subdirectories in the chullGraham directory:

  README        This file.

  Makefile	Makefile to compile and test programs

  data/         subdirectory containing sample input files:
                        (see README file in this subdirectory)

  graham.ccp    CORE version of graham-orig.c
                Input is 2D bigFloats points (non-homogeneous coordinates)
		Output can in one of two forms:
		  (a) postscript file to display convex hull
		  (b) convex hull points as 4D bigFloat points
		  	in homogenous coordinates
			NOTE: the 4D points have the form (x,y,0,1).

  graham4.ccp   A version of graham.ccp in which the
                input and output are 4D integer points in homogenous
                        coordinates.  These are for compatibility
			with LEDA window applications.

  graham-orig.c O'Rourke's original C source code
                Input are integer 2D points.
                Read leading comments there.

  macros.h      Include file for O'Rourke's original program.
