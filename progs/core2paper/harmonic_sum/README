TODO: compare the accuracy of ln(n) to the
	summation S(n)=\sum_{i=1}^n (1/i).

Experiments for the "summation operation" test,
as described in Core2 paper (Jan 2010).
Test is taken from /progs/benchmark/sum, part of Zilin's thesis.

We test two versions of summation:
	tSum1 -- is the original Expr which builds a deep
		unbalanced DAG tree.
	tSum2 -- uses inbuilt summation operator to prevent building
		a deep unbalanced DAG tree.

Timing (in microseconds):
===============================================
n	Timing w/o sum	Timing w/ sum	Speedup
=====	==============	=============	=======
10^3	9		5		1.8
10^4	235		59		4.0
10^5	(seg fault)	1389		N/A
10^6	(seg fault)	105970		N/A
