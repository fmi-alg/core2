Examples of the anary operators "summation" and "product"
and the speedup's they afford.  The programs are called tSum.cpp
and tProd.cpp.  

You can compile them to either use
	(1) the obvious sum/prod of expressions, or
	(2) the built-in anary operator called summation/product.
The Makefile will compile both versions of these programs,
	(tSum1 vs. tSum2 and tProd1 vs. tProd2).

The program tProdConverge.cpp is used to verify that our
arbitrary product is converging to pi/2.
