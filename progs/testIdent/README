SYNOPSIS:
	testIdent.ccp includes a set of identity tests
		involving various basic arithmetic opertaions. 

	Most of them are adapted from
		a similar test program in the LiDIA distribution.

	testBound.cpp -- further tests


TO DO:
	Not all CORE functions are exercised here!

	testIdent is basically for Level 3 Accuracy.
		Ought to extend to all the other levels.
