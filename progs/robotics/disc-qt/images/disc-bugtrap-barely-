 disc-bugtrap-barely-nopath

 	This is the "bug trap" environment that makes life difficult for
 	probabilistic motion planning based on PRM...

	Interesting parameters to try for running this example:

	Example 1:
		radius = 10,  epsilon = 5,  start = (200,350), goal = (30,30)
		
		Our software reports "No Path".
		But visually, you will see a green path that has to pass
		between two green boxes through a shared corner, but these two
		boxes do not share an edge.  In other words, there is NO green channel.
	
	Example 2:
		Same parameters as before, but epsilon = 4.
		Now, our disc program finds a Path.
