README file for $(corelib)/progs/robotics
Core Library (since version 2.1, Oct 2019)
============================================================
Description:
	This directory is for path planning in robotics based
	on the SSS framework.
	It is a complete re-design of our previous path planners
	(including disc, triangle, 2-link, rod, ring)
	under a common framework.
	
	Each module of this redesign is in its own folder:

    README      -- this file
    Makefile    -- Type "make" to compile programs in the
                subfolders 
Folders:
    CORE        -- numbers, intervals, algebra, geometry from Core
                        Library (this is currently just a copy of CORE)
    datastruc   -- Graph, UnionFind, Queue 
    display     -- graphical routines
    inputs      -- Instances for path planning
                        Note: instance = (env,robot,start,goal,eps,...)
    robots      -- various robots are represented by their configuration
                        space and associated predicates
    strategy    -- various strategies for SSS
    sss         -- Soft Subdivision Search (the main algorithm)
    subdiv      -- subdivision datastructure
    utility     -- file parsers, timers, etc.

    These folders have have a dependency structure that is
    a DAG (directed acyclic graph) rooted at SSS:

                        SSS
