README File for "ball" demo

Sep 28, 2013:
Surin,
	Several of the examples seems to bugs -- the ball
	seems to move through the obstacles.

	"ega" and "egb".

UPDATE (Oct 10, 2013): this now seems to be fixed.

	But it happens very fast, and it suggests that we need to
	improve the animation -- you should break a long path
	into shorter intermediate positions for the purposes of animation.

IMPROVEMENT OF DEMO:
(1) Improving Animation.
	We want the ball to move more smoothly.
	Suppose you first compute a number (F) of frames (using the user
	choice for speeding up the demo).  Faster speed corresponds to smaller F.

	Sum up the length of all the line segments in a path.
	Call this total length L.  Intuitively, you would like
	to show a frame for every L/F distance.

	If a segment has length s, then you display  1+ floor(sF/L) frames
	for that segment.

(2) Default viewpoint of the demo.
	For each demo, I should be able to specify (using the Makefile, of course)
	the most useful initial viewing point.

	In the GLU library, there is a function called

		gluLookAt(eyeX, eyeY, eyeZ, atX, atY, atZ, upX, upY, upZ)

	specify the "eye" position, "look-at" position, and a direction for "UP".

	So we want to add to the following last line to your call:

	./ball $(interactive) \
	        $(startX) $(startY) $(startZ)  $(goalX) $(goalY) $(goalZ) \
		$(epsilon) $(radius) $(fileName) \
		$(boxWidth) $(windowPosX) $(windowPosY) \
		$(Qtype) $(seed)  $(inputDir) \
		$(xtrans) $(ytrans) $(ztrans) $(scale) \
		$(eyeX) $(eyeY) $(eyeZ) $(atX) $(atY) $(atZ) $(upX) $(upY) $(upZ) \
		&

(3) Simple features:
	Reset:
		We should be able to reset the viewing position to the original,
		See the latest 2-links example for many of such features...
	Axes:
		I like the origin and the x/y/z axes to be drawn
		(helps us understand construction of obstacles)
