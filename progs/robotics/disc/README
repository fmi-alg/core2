OVERVIEW:
	This is the simplest example of our technique of using soft predicates
	for resolution-exact algorithms for motion planning.

	The framework is called "SSS" (for Soft Subdivision Search).
	It is a very flexible robust framework for motion planning,
	analogous to the PRM framework.

	Implementation is also very easy to do "exactly".   
	Currently, we do not find the need to use arbitrary precision
	computation, but this is easy to do in Core Library.

	The idea of Soft Predicate is that we classify boxes
	in configuration space as

		FREE, STUCK or MIXED.

	The predicate is "conservative" in the sense FREE or STUCK classifications
	are correct (i.e., really free and really stuck).
	In the limit, as boxes converges to a free or stuck point, this 
	classification will converge to the correct value.

	We guarantee: there is a constant K>1 such that
		(1) if there is a path with clearance at least K*Epsilon,
			then we will find a path of clearance at least Epsilon/K
		(2) if there is no path with clearance Epsilon/K, 
			then we will return "No Path".
	The constant K is sqrt(2) here.

	There are many possible strategies for expansion.  Here we implement:

		(0) Random
		(1) Breadth First Search
		(2) Greedy Best First
		------------------ TO DO:
		(3) Dijkstra and A-Star
		(5) Voronoi diagram based searches
		(6) Hybrids (any combination of the above)
	
	Comparison with PRM methods are planned.

UPDATES:
============================================================
July 17-20, 2013: our paper describing this work appeared at the
	ACM Symposium on Computational Geometry in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
July 27, 2013: the paper describing SSS in a general setting won the
	Best Paper Award at "Robotics Challenge and Vision Workshop" at
	the Robotics Science and Systems Conference in Berlin, Germany.
	This award is sponsored by  Computing Community Consortium (CCC).
March, 2015: taught robot motion planning class at NYU,
	students ported this to Visual Studio and Linux.
	Also implemented a Voronoi Heuristic.
