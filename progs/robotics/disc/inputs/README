# Our basic 2d polygonal format is this:
# This is a sample file format for input
# 	It supports:
#     	(1) rest-of-line comment character is '#'
#	(2) initial space, tabs and newlines are ignored.
#	(3) continuation line character is '\'
#
# It a sequence of lines with these elements:
#
# (1) Number of points:
# 	N
#
# (2) Coordinates of the N points in a single line:
#
#	x1 y1 x2 y2 ...    xN yN
#
#	The coordinates xi, yi can be integers or decimal values 
# 	The point (xi,yi) has index i (for i=1,2,...,N)
#	TODO: should allow optional commas, to help visualize the separate points:
#		x1 y1, x2 y2, x3 y3, ...
#
# (3) Number of polygons:
#	M
#
# (4) Follows M lines, one for each polygon:
#
#	p11 p12 p13 ...
#	p21 p22 p23 p24 ...
#	...
#	pM1 pM2 ...
#
# where
# 	each polygon is given by a sequence of point indices (1 to N)
# 		E.g., 1 9 12 3 5 1
#	The polygons are closed, so the last index must the same
#		as the first index. 
# 	The interior of polygon is left of the directed edges:
# 		So the interior is finite iff the indices are listed
# 		in counter-clockwise order
# 	E.g. 
# 		2 3 8 2
# 	and
# 		2 8 3 2
# 	are two triangles but one has finite interior, the
# 	other has finite exterior.
#	Degenerate polygons (line segment, or polygonal lines) are OK:
#		E.g.,
#		5 2 5
#		5 2 7 9 11 9 7 2 5
#
# 	If your polygon is non-simple, the effects are
# 	somewhat unpredictable (it is predictable, of course, but
# 	harder to figure out).
#
#  EXAMPLE:  Suppose we want to represent an obstacle set whose
#		complement is a triangular annulus:
#                            /\
#                           /  \
#                          / /\ \
#                         / /  \ \
#                        / / A  \B\  C
#                       / -------- \ 
#                      --------------    
#	where A and C are interior to the obstacle set,
#	but B is exterior to the set. 
#	Thus the outer triangle must be listed clockwise,
#	and the inner triangle must be listed counter-clockwise.
