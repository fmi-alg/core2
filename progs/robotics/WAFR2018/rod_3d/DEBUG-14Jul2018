
Debugging the code for 

        ConfBox3dPredicate::CheckCollisionFeatureBox,

	(1) First construct 4 half spaces of the square cone
	
		This is correct
	
	(2) Construct the 5th half-space:
	
		Your "emplace_back(bottom_H, -n)"  is wrong.
		You should simply use half-space H that whose boundary
		\partial(H) contains the face of the box B^t
	      	that is parallel to the square B^r.   
		There are two such half-spaces -- the
		correct one is the one whose direction from the center of the
		box is the opposite of the direction of the square B^r.
		E.g., if B^r has direction (-1,0,0) then \partial(H)
		has direction (+,0,0).   If B^r has direction (0,+1,0), then
		\partial(H) has direction (0,-1,0).
	
		In general, let  Dx=(+,0,0), -Dx=(-,0,0)
				 Dy=(0,+,0), -Dy=(0,-,0)
				 Dz=(0,0,+), -Dz=(0,0,-)
		Say direction of B^r is Di (i=x,y,z), then
			choose H to be the face of B^t with direction -Di

    		It may be easier to describe this on Skype.
	
	(3) Construction of the "pole" (I suggest calling it the
		"axis" of the cone) in CORE/geom3d/segment3d.cpp 
		is wrong.  It should simply be the segment
		
			[m(B^t), m(B^t)+ m(B^r)*1e6]
