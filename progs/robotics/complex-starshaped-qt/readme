#	taken from triangle code.



# TODO:
--	run() should set up signals to allow interruption.
--	SHOULD NOT PASS epsilon around to methods.  
		Should be global.
--	geom2d should know how to 
		construct lines from 2 points
	
-- 	WE SHOULD USE CoreLib's geom2d.

		RIGHT NOW, we are just duplicating

--	Do memory leak check (delete/new)

--	In Box.cpp, outerDomain is NOT used (line 730)
			SHOULD FIX THIS.
