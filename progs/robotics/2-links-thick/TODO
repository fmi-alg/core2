TODO:

(1) The green boxes should be called "free" not "mixed"
	Please change the output function

(2) Use **dashed** line to connect start/goal configuration

(3) I am confused: why are some boxes in the middle of
	the regions colored grey, but others green???

(4) More strategies

(5) Develop a true Voronoi strategy.
