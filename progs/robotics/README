Description:
	This directory has various subdirectoris containing algorithms
	for robotics, especially motion planning.

	(1) Subdirectory 2d-disc:
	This implements the SSS algorithm for moving a disc amidst polygonal
	obstacles, using the soft-predicated described in the
	paper "Numerical Subdivision Methods in Motion Planning" by
	Y.-J.Chiang and C.Yap (2011).

	(2) Subdirectory triangle:
	This implements the SSS algorithm for moving a disc amidst polygonal
	obstacles, using the soft-predicated described in the
	paper "On Soft Predicates in Subdivision Motion Planning"
	by C.Wang, Y.-J. Chiang and C.~Yap, SoCG 2013, Rio de Janeiro.
        To appear CGTA, Special Issue for SoCG'13.

	(3) Subdirectory 2-links:
	This implements the SSS algorithm for a 2-link robot using the T/R
	technique for subdivision described in the paper
	"Resolution Exact Algorithms for Link Robots",
	by Z. Luo, Y.-J. Chiang, J.-M. Lien and C. Yap,
	in WAFR 2014, Istanbul Turkey.  It is also in the MS thesis of
	Z.Luo (2014) at Courant Institute, NYU.

	(4) Subdirectory non-cross-links:
	This extends 2-link robot to a restricted free space in which
	the links are not allowed to self-cross (so the free-space is
	a Torus minus non-disconnecting a closed loop).  See the MS thesis of
	Z.Luo (2014) at Courant Institute, NYU.

	(5) Subdirectory ball:
	This is the work of Surin Ahn, a high school student at Mamaroneck
	Union Free School, supervised by Chee Yap.  She was a Regional Finalist
	from New York State in the 2013 Siemens Math, Science and Technology
	Competition (one of 100 students nationwide).  

	(6) Subdirectory ball:
	This is the work of Surin Ahn, a high school student at Mamaroneck
	Union Free School, supervised by Chee Yap.  She was a Regional Finalist
	from New York State in the 2013 Siemens Math, Science and Technology
	Competition (one of 100 students nationwide).
